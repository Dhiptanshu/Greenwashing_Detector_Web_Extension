“We’re absolutely thrilled to have this spring collection made out of sustainable materials. → ⚠️ Likely Greenwashing (99.9% sure it's *not* a claim)

- With feminine, easy-going silhouettes, dreamy floral prints and separates all created by our in-house design team that can easily be mixed and matched, it shows how style and sustainability can work together beautifully."

 Maria Östblom, Head of Design Womenswear

The floral prints and earthy colours of the H&M Conscious Collection for Spring 2019 are a perfect complement to the feminine details, such as ruffles, off-the shoulder necklines and balloon sleeves. → 🤔 Not an Environmental Claim

- The warm brown pleated tube top with a string halterneck in recycled polyester looks equally stunning with the matching tiered lace maxi-skirt, also in recycled polyester, as it would with a pair of jeans, while the white floral print voluminous mini-dress with ruffled v-neck, three-quarter length sleeves and a dropped waist in organic cotton is beach and brunch-ready. → ⚠️ Likely Greenwashing (99.8% sure it's *not* a claim)

- Throughout the month of April, H&M will not only celebrate their sustainability actions and goals as a company, but also highlight the Conscious Collection in stores all around the world. → 🤔 Not an Environmental Claim

- H&M are proud that the entire collection has been made from sustainably-sourced materials, which not only emphasises the H&M Group’s status as one of the world’s largest users of organic cotton, Tencel and recycled polyester, but also shows the continued efforts, commitment and progress we are making for a sustainable fashion future. → ⚠️ Likely Greenwashing (99.1% sure it's *not* a claim)

- “This Conscious Collection is a wonderful step towards meeting one of our main goals – to use only 100% recycled or other sustainably-sourced materials by 2030. → ⚠️ Likely Greenwashing (99.4% sure it's *not* a claim)

- Sustainability is one of our core values and while there is a lot of work going into this throughout the entire value chain, it’s always exciting to see the more consumer-facing campaigns really showcase our conscious way of thinking.”
